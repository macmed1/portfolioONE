                            <p>Welcome to my portfolio. My objective is to give you an idea of my work and accomplishment. My goal is to build something that can benefit peoples in general.
                             If I build something that saves people the time to do long research or even prevent them from  doing tedious task or record keeping than I ve accomplished my mission.</p>
                            <p>I dont want to just build something that can help people in general, I want to be able to make a difference in that person's life as well.
                             Allowing my programs to take care of the simple tasks that takes up a lot of time doing so that that time can be transferred to doing something that is more beneficial to the users. </p>

                        <h3>BasketBall reps App</h3>
                        <p>This is a description of the Basketball reps App I built. This App should provide the lovers of the game the chance to improve their skills set. It has an in depth curriculum and step by step break down on what to do to develop your game level.</p> 
                        <p>It is user friendly and it also provides a lot of insights that professional players get. I also have spent a lot of time making sure that the app can be used no matter which level the users would have with different settings that are fully customizable and adjustable whether you are a beginner or a savvy athlete.</p>
                        <p>I'll share what my goal was in creating it, the skills/languages I applied, and what I learned doing it.</p>

                            <p> One of the main feature in the anylisis it provides from other step-tracking devices. Your iPhone can track steps using a built-in accelerometer, which gathers data based on the speed and movement of your phone.</p>
                            <p>Since this app is web based it requires to  sync data from your I phone app so that it can deliver its analysis.</p> 
                            <p> The main objective is to make it easy to use and add more health tips and suggestions as a complement to what you could do while staying healthy. And if you could have better understanding of your progress on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly base.</p>
