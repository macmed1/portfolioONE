                            <p>Welcome to my portfolio. My goal is to build something that will benefit people on a daily base in their daily routine.
                             If I my programs can save people the time to do long research or prevent them from  doing tedious task or record keeping than I would have accomplished my mission.</p>
                            <p>I want to be able to make a difference in that person's life as well.
                             Allowing my programs to take care of the simple tasks so that in return that time can be transferred to doing something that is more beneficial to the users. </p>

                            <p>A little more about myself and my background. I was born and grew up in Paris, France, my family originated from West africa Guinea.</p>
                            <p>In a world and a society that is constantly evolving and changing I found a new passion in Coding. This passion has given me the opportunity to improvbe my communication, creativity, math, writing and confidence.</p> <p> In addition to thatI have always loved sports and the healthy lifestyles that comes with embracing it.</P>  
                            <p>After Moving to New York and completing my education with a Degree in Business and a Minor in Computer Applications I moved to san francisco Bay area which is where I now call home.</p>
                            <p>I have been working in the tech world for the past five years where I started to really develop a strong passion for coding.</P>
                            <P>When I'm not coding, I love working out , playing basketball or simply just taking advantage of the great outdoors.</p>

                            <h3>BasketBall reps App</h3>
                            <p>This is a description of the Basketball reps App I built. This App should provide the lovers of the game the chance to improve their skills set. It has an in depth curriculum and step by step break down on what to do to develop different area of your game.</p> 
                            <p>It is user friendly and it provides insights that only professional players usually get. I have spent time making sure that the app can be used no matter which level the users have. It has different settings that are fully customizable and adjustable whether you are a beginner or a savvy athlete.</p>
                            <p>I'll share what my goal was in creating it, the skills/languages I applied, and what I learned doing it.</p>

                            <h3>Healthy lifestyle App</h3>
                            <p> One of the main feature in the analysis this app provides is that unlike other step-tracking devices, it uses data from your IPhone built-in accelerometer (data based on the speed and movement of your phone)to deliver a in depth description of your daily progress and gives you suggestions on how to proceed.</p>
                            <p>Since this app is web based it requires to  sync data from your I phone app to your computer so that it can deliver its analysis.</p> 
                            <p> The main objective is to make the data more user friendly , in addition to a more precise and tailored health tips and suggestions. A better understanding of your progress on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly base reinforces more performing healthier lifestyles habits.</p>
